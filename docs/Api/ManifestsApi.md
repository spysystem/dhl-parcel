| Method | HTTP request | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [**getManifests()**](ManifestsApi.md#getManifests) | **GET** /manifests | Retrieve daily manifest document |
| [**manifestsPost()**](ManifestsApi.md#manifestsPost) | **POST** /manifests | Mark shipments as being ready for shipping |


## `getManifests()`

```php
getManifests($billing_number, $date, $include_docs, $accept_language): \Spy\DHLParcel\Model\SingleManifestResponse
```

Retrieve daily manifest document

Return the manifest document for the specific date (abbreviated ISO8601 format YYYY-MM-DD). If no date is provided, the manifest for today will be returned. The manifest PDF document will list the shipments for your EKP, separated by billing numbers. Potentially, the document is large and response time will reflect this. <br />Additionally, the response contains a mapping of billing numbers to sheet numbers of the manifest and a mapping of shipment numbers to sheet numbers.<br />The call can be repeated as often as needed. Should a date be provided which is too old or lies within the future, HTTP 400 is returned.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = Spy\DHLParcel\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('dhl-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = Spy\DHLParcel\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('dhl-api-key', 'Bearer');

// Configure HTTP basic authorization: BasicAuth
$config = Spy\DHLParcel\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()
              ->setUsername('YOUR_USERNAME')
              ->setPassword('YOUR_PASSWORD');


$apiInstance = new Spy\DHLParcel\Api\ManifestsApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$billing_number = 'billing_number_example'; // string | Customer billingNumber number.
$date = 'date_example'; // string
$include_docs = 'include'; // string | Legacy name **labelResponseType**. Shipping labels and further shipment documents can be:  * __include__: included as base64 encoded data in the response (default)  * __URL__: provided as URL reference.  Default is include the base64 encoded labels.
$accept_language = de-DE; // string | Control the APIs response language via locale abbreviation. English (en-US) and german (de-DE) are supported. If not specified, the default is english.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->getManifests($billing_number, $date, $include_docs, $accept_language);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling ManifestsApi->getManifests: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;

## `manifestsPost()`

```php
manifestsPost($shipment_manifesting_request, $accept_language, $all): \Spy\DHLParcel\Model\MultipleManifestResponse
```

Mark shipments as being ready for shipping

Shipments are normally ''closed out'' at a fixed time of the day (such as 6 pm, configured by EKP/account) for the date provided as shipDate in the create call.  <br />This call allows forcing the closeout for sets of shipments earlier. This will also override the original shipDate. Afterwards, the shipment cannot be changed and the shipment labels cannot be queried anymore (however they may remain cached for limited duration).  Calling closeout repeatedly for the same shipments will result in HTTP 400 for the second call. HTTP 400 will also be returned if the automatic closeout happened prior to the call. It is however possible to add new shipments, they will be manifested as well and be part of the day's manifest.  <br />Note on billing: The manifesting step has billing implications. Some products (Warenpost, Parcel International partially) are billed based on the shipment data available to DHL at the end of the day. All other products (including DHL Paket Standard) are billed based on production data. For more details, please contact your account representative.   #### Request It's changing the status of the shipment, so parameters are provided in the body.  * ''profile'' attribute - defines the user group profile. A user group is permitted to specific billing numbers. Shipments are only closed out if they belong to a billing number that the user group profile is entitled to use. This attribute is mandatory. Please use the standard user group profile ''STANDARD_GRUPPENPROFIL'' if no dedicated user group profile is available.  * ''billingNumber'' attribute - defines the billing number for which shipments shall be closed out. If a billing number is set, then only the shipments of that billing number are closed out. In that case no list of specific shipment numbers needs to be passed.  * ''shipmentNumbers'' attribute - lists the specific shipping numbers of the shipments that shall be closed out.  If all shipments shall be closed, the query parameter ''all'' needs to be set to ''true''. In that case neither a billing number nor a list of shipment numbers need to be passed in the request body.   #### Response  * Closing status for each shipment
